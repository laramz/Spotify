# Excercise Checklist

This checklist should help you keeping track of your exercises. Remember that you have to hand in satisfactory solutions to at least two thirds of the exercises. If you're part of the beginner track this refers to two thirds of part A (EDA) only. If you're part of the advanced track, you have to hand in at least two thirds of both individual parts A and B. Hence, you cannot hand in 100 percent of the first part and only 50 percent of the second one. You'll need more than 66% in each one for a certificate. After all, you're not really that advanced if you only did half of it, right?

**Part A: Exploratory Data Analysis (Beginners + Advanced)**

**Data: Kaggle Data**

1. **Getting Started** 

1.1 Read in data, show data, give summary of data (mean, count,...)

1.2 Compute column "duration_minutes" from "duration_ms"

1.3 Compute mean/std of duration_minutes, which song has the longest duration?

1.4 Plot histogram of song durations


2. **Time Series: How did songs change over the years?**

2.1 Streaming leads to shorter songs? Group-By: song duration over years

2.2 Merge songs with song_features on id

2.3 Compare how features like 'acousticness', 'danceability', 'energy', 'instrumentalness' changed over time

2.4 For Advanced: Radial plot over time

3. **Artists**

3.1 Bar Plot with artists with most songs

3.2 TODO: Map & merge

4. **Pairplot: Artist Comparison**

4.1 Look for three different artists and compare the features of the songs with a pairplot

4.2 Go on https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html# , look for a plot which could be used to visualize an aspect of the spotfiy data and generate a plot

4.3 What is the message of your plot? What does it show?


**Data: Personal Spotify Data**

5. **Personal Data**

5.1 Generate Bar Plot with top 10 artists

5.2 Visualize when you listened to music. On which days, to which times?


**Part B: Popularity Prediction Using Statistical Methods ((motivated) Beginners + Advanced)**


**Data: Kaggle Data**

1. Create correlation plot between features

2. Regression 

2.1 Create simple linear model to predict popularity of song

2.2 Improve your model using more features

3. Train/ Test your model 

4. Develop more advanced models
